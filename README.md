Sample Base Repository For Cloning

This is an initial Repository Design for my personal work. 

Settings will be sepecific to the code but there will always be a stucture to break the code into:

1) Code structure based on the language (PHP, Ruby, C, Python, etc).

2) Unit tests base on the language structure.

3) Database structure language base on the targeted database application (MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, Memcache, etc)
   to act as a datastore. This may also include NonSQL like MongoDB, memcache. 
   
4) Bin, include, and library files as required per repository application.

5) Documentation based on the automated code generate documentation per application. 

While this repository is for my personal use, all public repositories are available for the public to use
with the warnings that it is demo code. As such, I am not liable if any code posted here interrupts, disrupts, 
or even screws up your machine or your business. However, it will probably screw up my machine way before any code
gets to this repository. As such, consider yourself warned that you assume all responsibilities and I have no 
liabilities or responsibility if you use the code.  

As far as a personal respository, why do I have one? Basically, I want to push myself harder and I want to contribute
to open source. My work experience includes handhelds to mainframes in different roles as design, develop, test, 
implement, and manage but I find that I am not getting the code and that I was bored with the client's stuff. However, 
my previous contracts prevented me from contributing to open source due to intellectual property issues. I have resolved
the IP issue and there is some much that I want to do with a few different application and technologies. Also, creating
my own respositories helps to make me better developer, coder, etc. I use to say that I like to walk in a room and be 
scared by the talent in the room. Fear to fail is a great personal motivator for me to exceed my and other's expectations.
However, now I want to be the best in the room,,,, period. Until then, I have many miles to travel. 

Enjoy your journey with me as I may not get there but the journey should be interested. Hhopefully, this repositry will
help your journey along. Cheers.
